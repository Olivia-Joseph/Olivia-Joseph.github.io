<h2 class="brief">Brief</h2>

<p class="text-white">
This is a university project where we were tasked with creating and implementing a visual communication campaign for a themed bar. Working in pairs, we developed a complete concept, starting with analysis and definition, followed by creating the visual identity, and finally producing various communication materials.

### **Objectives**

- Understand ecosystems, user needs, and digital communication devices.
- Design a strategic response to a complex problem.
- Express a message using digital media for information and communication.
- Undertake initiatives in the digital sector.

### **Process**

Once we established our concept, we began designing the logo. Initially, we each explored different identities individually. After several iterations, we decided to create a logo with custom shapes reminiscent of the western theme. We developed about twenty logo variations and selected the one that best represented our bar's identity and theme.
